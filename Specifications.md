# Problem statement
### Impact:
In Seattle, residents are facing significant challenges in keeping up with the rising food prices and many are struggling to afford groceries. High food inflation is affecting people across the income spectrum. Although higher income individuals do have better selection of produce and grocery options, Seattle metro area households still spend an average of $289 per week on groceries, while the national average is only $270 [1] as Seattle food costs are among the highest in the country. This translates to at least $1,150 a month. At the other end, low income individuals are facing the greatest pressure with many of them struggling to stretch food budgets by cutting back on meals, seeking aid from local and government resources, such as food banks, and buying cheaper processed foods.  With numerous grocery stores and varying prices, it can be time-consuming and difficult for consumers to compare prices and make informed purchasing decisions. This often leads to overspending on groceries and increased strain on household budgets, which perpetuate food insecurity pressures especially in an area with a high cost of living.
The impact of rising food prices is that a much greater number of people are facing food insecurity and the resulting detrimental effects of health issues and economic strain. While food insecurity can be caused by poverty, food insecurity can also cause poverty, which can lead people to get trapped in food insecurity cycles due to their financial status. In King County,  “an estimated 10.5 percent of people (roughly 243,000) experience food insecurity”, and “food insecure adults and children are more likely to experience poor physical, oral, and mental health than food secure people” [2]. Food insecurity has significant consequences on a person’s physical health as it increases the risk of chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and heart disease. Oftentimes, the increased cost of food leaves many individuals with no choice but to purchase less expensive and less nutritious foods, leading to negative health outcomes. Additionally, the increased costs can take up a large amount of the budgets of lower income households, leaving less allocation towards better healthcare or education.
### Quantified Scope:
The City of Seattle has a population of 737,015 as of 2020 [3]. According to the most recent Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Report (2018-2021) conducted by the King County, 10.3% of adults reported that they experienced food insecurity [4]. Areas impacted by racial and socioeconomic injustices experience the highest food insecurity. In particular, households in Southeast Seattle neighborhoods of South Beacon Hill, Georgetown, and South Park have an average food insecurity rate of 26.5%, with some areas experiencing food insecurity rates as high as 40.8% [4]. Rainier Valley and Rainier Beach neighborhoods had a food insecurity rate of 17.9%, while downtown Seattle, Belltown, and First Hill areas had a food insecurity rate of 13.2% [4]. Local surveys have found that Black and Hispanic/Latinx households are twice as likely to experience food insecurity than white households, with rates ranging from 26.6-32.4% [4]. Approximately 6 in 10 homes in Seattle are located within 0.5 miles of a grocery store, but some neighborhoods in low-income areas, such as South Park, Riverview, High Point, and Highland Park do not have access to a grocery store [5] . 
### Causes:
Several factors that may be contributing to this might be the disruptions and high demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The OECD states that “COVID-19 is also likely to lead to higher food prices in the developing world due to disruptions to logistics” [6]. The price of increased manufacturing and shipping food is likely offset to customers when purchasing goods from grocery stores. In addition to COVID-19, international conflicts, animal disease, plant disease, and other factors occurring simultaneously may be contributing to the increasing food prices [7]. Climate change and extreme heat has resulted in droughts that have reduced the amount of fruit and vegetable crops and crops used to feed livestock, driving up the cost of fresh produce and meat. 
One of the most direct contributing causes of food insecurity is having a low income. Seattle residents face annual expenditures that are higher than the national average of $70,052 [8]. In 2021 to 2022, the average annual expenditure of Seattle residents was $93,905 with 11.2% consisting only of food costs [8]. This means that on average Seattle residents are paying approximately $1,700 more on food, which is a substantial part of many people’s household budgets that could be going towards other necessities. Living in areas with high costs of living increases the financial burden, with those who have a low income feeling the greatest pressure, increasing the likelihood of experiencing food insecurity.
### Existing Solutions:
Some of the existing solutions such as food assistance programs and local food production fall short due to their limitations. Food assistance programs provide some support towards offsetting the effects of high food costs, but are not sufficient enough to cover the full extent of Seattle’s cost of living due to various reasons, one of them being expiring benefits [9]. Hopelink is a community organization that operates five food markets and a mobile market in King County [1]. In January 2024, Hopelink served 8,821 people at the markets, which is 14% higher than the number of people served in August 2023 [1]. More and more people are seeking and need access to these services. However, the program currently has a $600,000 funding gap for the current fiscal year since the federal stimulus money after COVID has expired [1]. Not every individual who is eligible for government food assistance programs uses them. This is because of  barriers in application requirements, such as proof of income, immigration status, and feeling shame or embarrassment for needing/using these programs. Additionally, local food production is limited by their reach, since access to vendors like local farmer’s markets might be out of reach for many individuals and the supply is limited compared to larger farms and outsourced crops.

# Solution Summary
Our product is a web application intended to help individuals in the Seattle Area limit their grocery costs and make more informed decisions when it comes to food. Our price comparison map allows users to compare the prices of items across different grocery stores in one place. This allows users to save costs by allowing them to plan meals ahead of time, find affordable alternatives more easily, and cook more meals from scratch rather than relying on packaged frozen foods. Oftentimes, the information on certain deals and item prices varies greatly from grocery store to grocery store and is found on online websites, emailed, or mailed coupons. Our website aims to consolidate this information, such that users can easily navigate grocery stores and find the best possible deals. Helping individuals optimize their food budgets when faced with rising food costs will help alleviate financial strain and decrease some of the pressures of facing food insecurity. Our stretch goal is to include a recipe recommendation feature that enables users to plan meals based on their custom ingredients as well as on sale items and ingredients at the store. Users can discover new recipes requiring ingredients they already have on hand, optimizing full utilization of food and leftovers.

# Design Specifications
## Homepage/Nav Bar 
Each page on the website will consist of the navigation bar, body, and footer. The homepage will contain information about our website and team name. The navigation bar will contain links to our price comparison map for groceries under the "Grocery Stores" tab, and recipe suggestion feature under the "Recipes" tab. Our recipe generation feature is a stretch goal (see details below) additionally if time permits we will add features that allow users to save favorite recipes and stores (stretch goal 2). In the case that we are able to add these saving features, we will include a profile tab on the Navigation Bar that will allow users to create an account and manage their profile information. 

Clicking the "Get Started" button will navigate users to the price comparison map. 

The footer will contain copyright information about our organization.

## Price Comparison Map Feature
The price comparison map page allows users to find groceries near a given location in the Seattle area. The map allows users to search for a grocery item and then compare prices across the grocery stores in the area (different grocery store chains). The map interactivity allows users to  easily visualize grocery prices geographically. We chose this approach in order to consolidate both price and distance/geographic information in one place, so individuals facing food insecurity can find the best prices closest to them. 

Our stretch goal for this feature is to also provide coupons or deals for a particular item that grocery stores may offer in addition to just the price information.

### User Interaction:
The map will be interactive allowing users to change location and look around. In particular, users will be able to select grocery items to search for. The algorithmic function will require matching the user's selected grocery items with items in our database and fetching the relevant price, item name, and store name and store location to display on the map and on the results page. This may also require sorting internal item matches in the database based on lowest price.

### Default View
<p>When the page loads, the default view is an empty map of Seattle. Currently, we expect this view to show nearby grocery stores. A search box will be displayed instructing users to search for grocery items.</p>
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/INFO442-Summer2024/g-team/assets/114948546/5d905e6d-1f71-4160-bb1d-6684798f7e16">


### After Searching 
<p>Once a user has entered a grocery item to search for in the field, if the search string is found as a grocery item in our database, the page content will update to populate the map. A list of the matches will be generated below the map that includes the item name, descriptive image, price, and the store. Results will be displayed and grouped by grocery store chain (i.e. if there are 2 Safeways nearby results for each store will not be shown separately).</p>
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/INFO442-Summer2024/g-team/assets/114948546/1aa76c97-c960-41a0-807c-cb6f31d06289">

<p>Zooming in and clicking on a particular grocery story landmark on the map will open up a popup that details the price of the item at that store.</p>

### Error State
<p>In the event that the user inputs a search string that is not included in our database of grocery store items, a "No Results Found" error message will be displayed. The user will then be prompted to try a new search.</p>
<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/INFO442-Summer2024/g-team/assets/114948546/2f0c7d11-e0ff-402f-b4fe-9d4fc7f61948">

## Stretch Goal 1 Recipe Generation Feature:
<p>A stretch goal for our website is to create a recipes page that enables users to input ingredients they have on hand, prompting the application to generate five recipes that incorporate those specific ingredients. This feature allows users to explore various meal options they can create, even with limited ingredients available, enhancing flexibility and creativity in meal preparation. The algorithmic functionality for this feature would include matching the searched string or recipe filters in the search recipes by ingredient API we found online (https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs#Search-Recipes-by-Ingredients). In the event that user's desired inputs are not found, we will display an error message that informs the user that no recipe results were found, prompting them to try a different search. </p> 

<p> Each recipe card will include recipe name and an image on the results page. Results from the recipes will be shown as clickable recipe cards that link to recipe steps, names, and ingredients. Users can select the filters shown at the top to filter the database of possible recipes by meal type. The algorithmic functionality will require matching user input clicks to the selected filter search strings, when searching for matches in our recipe database. </p>

## Stretch Goal 2 Adding favorited recipes, saved stores/coupons: 
<p>Our second stretch goal involves enhancing user engagement by allowing them to favorite recipes for future reference. This feature would enable users to easily revisit and recreate their preferred dishes, accessible via their profile. Additionally, we plan to integrate a functionality where users can view available vouchers or coupons while browsing recipes. This integration aims to make meal preparation more affordable by offering discounts on ingredients, thereby enhancing the user experience and providing tangible benefits. </p> Implementing this feature will require us to create a profile page where users can change their account information and access their saved items. On the backend, this will require us to set up a database that handles user login authentication and includes security features, ensuring that user's sensitive information is secure.</p>
